# Using Redis

Redis is a source-available, in-memory storage, used as a distributed, in-memory key-value database, cache and message broker, with optional durability.

It can improve the performance of Next.js by moving from standard filesystem cache to memory.

## Setup in the project

Redis is exposed using the internal `@repo/redis` package that sits inside `packages/redis`.

Next.js will load the Redis cache handler if the `REDIS_HOST` environment variable is present:

```sh
REDIS_HOST="localhost"
REDIS_PORT="6379"
```

It's expected that a Redis instance is available, it can be setup locally using `redis-stack-server`,
and it's also recommended to use the app `Redis Insight` to monitor and see what is being cached.
Next.js also provides an extra debug option that can be enabled via environment variable:

```sh
NEXT_PRIVATE_DEBUG_CACHE="1"
```

## Features

- Cache handler integration will automatically make Next.js to use Redis as cache storage without any further actions
- The Cache handler only works in production mode, so it's necessary to build and start next.js
- Exposes a Redis client that can be imported from the repo. Example:
```ts
import { getRedisClient } from "@repo/redis";

const redis = getRedisClient();
redis.set("prefix:key", "value");
// ...
const value = redis.get("prefix:key");
```
Bear in mind that we still should rely on next.js for caching, and the redis client should be used for very specific cases.
