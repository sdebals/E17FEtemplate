# Using Sentry

Sentry is the standard tool for performance monitoring:

> With performance monitoring, Sentry tracks application performance, measuring metrics like throughput and latency,
and displaying the impact of errors across multiple services. Sentry captures distributed traces consisting of transactions
and spans to measure individual services and operations within those services.

## Features:

Sentry for next.js offers the following features:

- Automatic Error Tracking with source maps for both JavaScript and TypeScript
- Automatic Tracing for both the client and server
- Errors and Performance support for Middleware and Edge routes in Vercel's edge runtime.
- Events enriched with device data
- Breadcrumbs created for outgoing HTTP request with XHR and Fetch, and console logs
- Release health for tracking crash-free users and sessions

## Setup in the project

Sentry configurations are placed in `packages/sentry` folder and can be consumed via `@repo/sentry`.

<div className="border border-red-400 bg-red-100 text-base px-4 py-0.5 mb-16">
**Attention:** By default Sentry is not enabled in the project. The main reason is that not all projects use Sentry,
and if not using we don't want it to be included in the final bundle.
Bear in mind that depending on your project, Sentry setup, and requirements, you may need to do some configuration adjustments.
</div>

Sentry will only work properly having at least the below variables defined:

```sh
SENTRY_ENABLED="true"
SENTRY_ORG="your-org-name"
SENTRY_PROJECT="your-project-name"
```

It also needs to be loaded from `packages/sentry/src/sentry.next.config.cjs` into `next.config.mjs`,

```js
const config = {
  // For all available options, see:
  // https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin#options
  org: process.env.SENTRY_ORG,
  project: process.env.SENTRY_PROJECT,
  // remaining settings
}
```

It's also mandatory to have 3 configuration files in the root folder:

```sh
├── apps
│   ├── web
│   │   ├── sentry.client.config.ts
│   │   ├── sentry.edge.config.ts
│   │   ├── sentry.server.config.ts
```

they are empty (to avoid Sentry module being bundled in client if not enabled)
and if Sentry is used it's necessary to copy the contents from the counterparts in the sentry package:

```sh
├── packages
│   ├── sentry
│   │   ├── src
│   │   │   ├── sentry.client.config.ts
│   │   │   ├── sentry.edge.config.ts
│   │   │   ├── sentry.server.config.ts
```


Sentry configurations are loaded via `.env` variables:

```sh
# If not present Sentry will not be loaded
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN="your-sentry-dsn-url"
# By default is false
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DEBUG="true"
# Optional and automatically loaded by Sentry (not applicable on the browser)
SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT="dev"
# For the SDK to be able to upload source maps to Sentry, you need to provide an auth token
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN="your-auth-token"
```

And finally is also necessary to uncomment the contents of `instrumentation.ts` file to be like:

```js
export async function register() {
  if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs') {
    await import('./sentry.server.config');
  }

  if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'edge') {
    await import('./sentry.edge.config');
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Global Errors

Next.js global errors are caught using the `global-error.tsx` in the app root:

```js
export default function GlobalError({ error }: { error: Error & { digest?: string } }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    Sentry?.captureException(error);
  }, [error]);

  return (
    <html lang="en">
      ...
    </html>
  );
}
```

### Testing if it's working

Sentry can be used to track errors on demand (but it's not recommended to use it as a logging mechanism).

Inside a component:

```js
<button
  type="button"
  onClick={() => {
    throw new Error("Sentry Frontend Error");
  }}
>
  Throw error
</button>
```

Inside an API route:

```js
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  throw new Error("API throw error test");
  return Response.json({}, { status: 500 });
}
```
