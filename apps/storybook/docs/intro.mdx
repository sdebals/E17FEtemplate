      ## Folder structure
      <p className="sb-section-item-paragraph">
        Like any other turborepo project, there is an `apps` and `packages folder`.
        The `apps` folder contains the `Storybook` app and the `Next.js` app
        The packages folder contains various internal modules that are consumed from each app:
      </p>
      <div>
      * `config-eslint` - base eslint configuration, consumed by other packages and apps
      * `config-tailwind` - base tailwindcss configuration, consumed by the ui package, Storybook and Next.js apps
      * `config-typescript` - base typescript configuration, consumed by other packages and apps
      </div>
